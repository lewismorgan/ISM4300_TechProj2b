# ISM4300_TechProj2b
Lewis Morgan

Assignment:

PROGRAM #2b: Based on what you have learned from the Conditional Statement example, write a C# Console Program with Conditional Statements that does the following: 

1. Ask the user what grade they expect to get in ISM 4300. They should enter an integer value.

2. Based on what the user has entered, have the program display their Letter grade per Syllabus for this course (note - if you wish to simplify your code you can ignore averages for +'s and -'s and just report a letter grade - e,g. A, B, C, D, F).
